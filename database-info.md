Woods (Drivers, Fairway Woods, Hybrids)
	•	Titleist Woods: Drivers – From the late 1990s onward Titleist’s driver models include the 975D (1998), 975J (2001), the 983K/E (2003), 905T/R/S (2005), 907D1/D2, 909D2/D3/D•Comp, 910D2/D3, 913D2/D3, 915D2/D3/D4, 917D2/D3, the TS series (TS1–TS4, ~2018) and the TSi series (TSi1–TSi4, ~2020) ￼ ￼. The latest Titleist drivers are the TSR series (TSR1–TSR4, 2022–2023) and the new GT series (GT1–GT4, 2024–2025) ￼ ￼. Fairway Woods – Notable Titleist fairways include older models like the 904F and 906F2/F4, progressing through the 909F2/F3, 910F, 913F, 915F, 917F2/F3, and the modern TS/TSi/TSR fairway woods (e.g. TSR2+, TSR2, TSR3 fairways) ￼. Hybrids – Titleist’s hybrid lineup has included models such as the 585.H and 503.H (early 2000s), then 909H, 910H, 913H/Hd, 915H/Hd, the 816H1/H2 and 818H1/H2 hybrids, followed by the TS2/TS3 and TSi hybrids, up to the latest TSR1/TSR2/TSR3 hybrids. These offerings illustrate Titleist’s consistent two-year release cycles for woods and hybrids ￼.
	•	Callaway Woods: Drivers – Callaway’s driver heritage begins with the S2H2 (1988) and the original Big Bertha (1991), which revolutionized driver design ￼ ￼. Subsequent iconic drivers include the Great Big Bertha (1995) and Biggest Big Bertha (1997) ￼. In the 2000s, Callaway launched the Hawkeye and C4 (early composite drivers), the ERC II (2002), and the Fusion FT series (e.g. FT-3, FT-5 in mid-2000s) ￼. The X-Series drivers like the X-460 (2005) and FT-i (2006–2007, known for its square head) are notable ￼. Modern era Callaway drivers introduced yearly lineups: Diablo Edge/Octane (2010–2011), RAZR Fit (2012) ￼, X Hot (2013) and FT Optiforce (2013) ￼, Big Bertha (2014 re-introduction) and Big Bertha Alpha models, XR (2015–2016), Great Big Bertha Epic (2017) with Jailbreak technology, Rogue (2018), Epic Flash (2019), Mavrik (2020), Big Bertha B21 (2020) ￼ ￼, Epic Speed/Max (2021), Rogue ST (2022), and the latest Paradym series (2023) ￼ ￼. Fairway Woods & Hybrids – Callaway’s fairway woods often share names with drivers: e.g. Big Bertha War Bird fairway (mid-90s) ￼, Steelhead fairways (Steelhead Plus, Steelhead III in late ’90s–early ’00s), X Hot and XR fairways, Epic and Rogue fairways, etc. Hybrids include the early Heavenwood hybrids, the X-Series and Bertha hybrids, and modern hybrids like Apex and Super Hybrid. (Callaway also popularized the hybrid-iron “FT i-brid” set in 2008) ￼.
	•	TaylorMade Woods: Drivers – TaylorMade’s legacy begins with the original steel Pittsburgh Persimmon (1979–1980), the first metal driver ￼ ￼. The Burner series (1983 Burner, later Burner Plus, Burner Bubble in 1995) was hugely successful ￼ ￼. The late ’90s brought the titanium 300 Series drivers (300, 320, 360 in 2000) ￼ ￼. In the 2000s, TaylorMade led innovation with the R series: the R510/R540/R580 with Inverted Cone Technology (2002) ￼, then the movable-weight R7 (2004) ￼, followed by R9 (2009), R11 (2011, white crown) and R1 (2013). The Burner name was revived with the lightweight Burner 07 and Burner SuperFast lines, and the Aeroburner (2015) ￼. In 2016, the M series debuted (M1 and M2 drivers with multi-material construction, later M3/M4 in 2018, M5/M6 in 2019) ￼ ￼. Next came the SIM (“Shape In Motion”) drivers in 2020 and SIM2 in 2021 ￼ ￼, and most recently the carbon-face Stealth (2022) and Stealth 2 (2023) drivers ￼ ￼. Fairways/Hybrids – TaylorMade’s fairway woods often mirrored driver branding: e.g. V Steel fairway woods (2001) became famous for their versatility, RocketBallz (RBZ) fairway (2012) was notoriously long, and recent lines include M series, SIM/SIM2 fairways and Stealth fairways. Hybrids (Rescue clubs) also follow suit (e.g. Rescue Mid, Burner Rescue, RBZ Rescue, SIM Rescue). Additionally, TaylorMade produced specialty mini-drivers like the Original One (2019) and 300 Mini Driver (2021) ￼ ￼.
	•	Ping Woods: Drivers – PING’s driver history features the persimmon-era Ping 1A (1960s) and early metal woods like the Ping Zing woods. The landmark was the Ping TiSi (late 1990s) and Ping ISI drivers. Ping’s modern driver families are usually lettered: the G series (for game-improvement) and i series (for better players). The Ping G2 (2004) and G5 (2005) led to a long-running G series: G10 (2007), G15 (2009), G20 (2011), G25 (2013), G30 (2014), G (2016), G400 (2017), G410 (2019), G425 (2020), and the newest G430 (2023) ￼. Ping also offered an i15 (2009) and i20 (2012) driver for lower handicaps, and unique models like the adjustable Ping Anser driver (2012). Fairways/Hybrids – Ping’s fairway woods and hybrids generally carry the same numbering as the drivers (G5 fairway, G400 hybrid, etc.), and they pioneered high-lofted fairway woods like the 7-wood early on. Ping’s hybrids are often called Rescue or simply the hybrid version of the iron series (e.g. G400 hybrid, i25 hybrid). Their modern hybrids include the G-series hybrids and the Ping Crossover (hybrid-iron) clubs. (Notably, Ping invented the Anser putter, but for woods they stick to numeric naming.)
	•	Cobra Woods: Drivers – Cobra’s legacy includes the oversized King Cobra metal drivers of the 1990s (one of the first to use an “oversize” 460cc design). In the 2000s, Cobra released the SZ (Speed Zone) and FP drivers, but a major hit was the Cobra LD series in mid-2000s (known for long-drive competition success). After being acquired by Puma, Cobra introduced colorful, technology-packed models: L4V (2008, carbon fiber body), ZL (2010), AMP series (2012), then the BiO Cell (2014) and Fly-Z (2015). The King Ltd (2016) featured a spaceport in the sole, followed by the popular King F6/F7/F8 (2016–2018) and the low-center-of-gravity F9 Speedback (2019). Recent models include SpeedZone (2020), Radspeed (2021), and LTDx (2022), and the 2023 line is Aerojet drivers (emphasizing aerodynamic speed). Fairways/Hybrids – Cobra fairway woods often mirror driver names (King Cobra, Fly-Z fairway, etc.), and Cobra was an early adopter of the Baffler rail technology in its hybrids/fairways. The Cobra Baffler hybrid (first introduced in the 1970s and later reintroduced) was one of the first popular utility clubs. Modern Cobra hybrids carry names like King F9 Hybrid, Radspeed Hybrid, etc., matching the driver lines.
	•	Others (Woods): Many other manufacturers produced woods worth mentioning. Mizuno – better known for irons, but drivers like the MP-001 (2003), MX-560 (2007), and more recently the ST190/ST200 (2019–2020) and ST-Z/ST-X (2021) have cult followings. Adams Golf – renowned for fairway woods and hybrids: the original Tight Lies fairway wood (mid-90s) was a breakthrough in shallow-face design. Adams’ hybrids (e.g. Idea Pro hybrids and Adams Idea a12/a7 etc.) were extremely popular on tour ￼. Tour Edge – their Exotics fairway woods (since mid-2000s) like the Exotics CB series gained a niche following for high performance. PXG – (Parsons Xtreme Golf) a newer brand (2015+) whose woods have model numbers like 0811 drivers, 0341 fairways, 0317 hybrids in various “Gen” iterations. Wilson – classic name, with historical drivers (e.g. Wilson Invex in 90s) and modern ones like D7 (2019) and D9 (2021) for value performance. Honma – a premium Japanese brand, known for its beautifully crafted drivers (e.g. TW737 series). Yonex – another Japanese brand, with notable “EZONE” drivers and previously the V-Mass line ￼. Bobby Jones (Jesse Ortiz design) had a line of premium drivers/fairways in mid-2000s. MacGregor – historical brand with persimmon woods (used by Jack Nicklaus), later metal drivers like MT 460. Tommy Armour – its 2018 Atomic driver and older drivers like the original Persimmon Silver Scot. Virtually all brands listed in the manufacturers section ￼ ￼ have made woods, but the above covers the major makes and their key models.

Irons (Sets and Individual Irons)

Callaway’s Great Big Bertha Tungsten-Titanium irons (circa 1997) introduced multi-material construction for more forgiveness ￼ ￼.
	•	Titleist Irons: Titleist’s iron lineup has evolved from 1970s blades to today’s high-tech designs. Early classics include the Tour Model blades of the 1970s–80s (e.g. Titleist Tour Model 1979, 1980) ￼. In the 1990s, Titleist introduced cavity-back designs under the DCI (Direct Contact Insert) name – for example, DCI Black and DCI Gold in 1993, followed by DCI 962 (1997) and DCI 981 (1998) game-improvement irons ￼ ￼. In the early 2000s, Titleist catered to better players with forged irons like the 690.MB/CB (2002) and 680/670 blades ￼, and offered combo sets like the 735.CM (2005) forged cavity-to-muscle back progression. Around 2008, Titleist launched the AP (Advanced Performance) series that modernized their offerings: AP1 (a forgiving cast model) and AP2 (forged players’ cavity) came in 2008 (710 series) ￼, updated as 712 AP1/AP2 (2011) ￼, 714 AP1/AP2 (2013), 716 AP1/AP2 (2015) ￼, and introduced a third model AP3 in the 718 series (2017) for a “better-player distance iron” ￼. Alongside, Titleist kept making MB (muscle-back) and CB (cavity-back) forged irons for purists – e.g. 712 MB/CB, 714 MB/CB, up to 718 MB/CB (2017) ￼ and the current 620 MB/CB (2019) ￼. In 2019, Titleist replaced the AP line with the T-Series irons: T100 (players cavity), T200 (players distance), T300 (game improvement), later adding T100S (strong-loft T100) and T400 (super game-improvement) ￼ ￼. The T-Series (T100–T400) have had iterations in 2019, 2021, and 2023 ￼ ￼. Titleist also produces specialty irons like the U•500/U•505 utility irons ￼ and the ultra-premium CNCPT limited models (CP-01, CP-02, CP-03, CP-04) ￼. Overall, Titleist’s iron lineage spans from old-school blades to modern multi-material designs, typically updated every two years ￼.
	•	Callaway Irons: Callaway entered the iron market in the late 1980s with the game-changing S2H2 irons (1988) that introduced a shortened hosel for weight redistribution ￼ ￼. These were followed by the Original Big Bertha Irons (1994), which were oversized, highly forgiving irons that set the standard for game-improvement clubs ￼. The Great Big Bertha Tungsten-Titanium irons (1997) added multi-material tech (tungsten inserts) to increase forgiveness ￼ ￼. In 1998 Callaway launched the X-Series with the Big Bertha X-12 irons ￼, followed by Steelhead X-14 (2000) and Steelhead X-16 (2003) irons ￼ ￼ – these were extremely popular mid-handicap irons. The X-Series continued with X-18 (2004) and X-20 (2006) irons ￼, and the better-player X-Tour forged irons (2005, designed with Phil Mickelson’s input). In 2007–2009, Callaway released the X-22 and X-22 Tour (2008) ￼, and the first X-Forged players irons (2007 & 2009 editions) ￼ ￼. The 2010s saw a broadening: Diablo Edge (2010 game-improvement) and Diablo Forged (2010 better-player) ￼; the RAZR X family (2011) with variants like RAZR X, X Tour, X Forged, and a super-forgiving RAZR X HL ￼ ￼; then RAZR Fit/XF hybrids and irons (2012). Callaway revived the Apex name (from the Hogan lineage they acquired) in 2013: the Apex 2013/14 forged irons were a hit for feel. They followed with X2 Hot irons (2014) for game improvement, and in 2015 launched the Apex CF 16 and Apex Pro 16 irons to great acclaim ￼ ￼. The XR and XR Pro irons (2015) focused on distance tech ￼, while Big Bertha 2015 irons introduced hollow-body designs. In 2016, the Steelhead XR irons brought back the Steelhead name with modern tech ￼, and Big Bertha OS irons used tungsten-loaded soles for high launch ￼. Callaway’s recent iron lines include: EPIC irons (2017, super-premium multi-piece construction), Rogue irons (2018, with Jailbreak tech in hybrids and irons) ￼, Apex 19 (2019, plus Apex Pro 19) ￼, the super-forged Epic Forged (2019) ￼, Mavrik irons (2020, using A.I.-designed faces in Standard/Max/Pro) ￼, Big Bertha B21 (2020) for max forgiveness, Apex 21 series (2021) including Apex DCB (Deep Cavity Back) and Apex TCB (Tour Cavity) for pros ￼ ￼, Rogue ST (2022) in Max, Max OS, OS Lite, and Pro variants ￼, and the latest Paradym irons (2023) including Paradym and Paradym X ￼ ￼. Callaway also continues to offer blades for elite players, like the Apex MB musclebacks (2020) ￼ and the updated X Forged CB (2020). In sum, Callaway’s iron offerings range from super-game-improvement (Bertha series, max OS models) to elite forged blades (Apex MB), covering every player segment ￼ ￼.
	•	Ping Irons: Ping made its mark in irons with perimeter-weighted designs that changed the game. In the 1980s Ping’s Eye series became legendary – the PING Eye2 irons (brought out 1982) were the best-selling iron of all time, famous for their extreme perimeter weighting and square grooves ￼ ￼. Variations like Eye2+ (1984–1990) offered refinements ￼. Ping also produced the Ping Zing irons (1988–93) with a unique toe-heavy design, and ISI irons (1998) as their first investment-cast stainless line. In the 2000s, Ping introduced the i (for intermediate players) and G (game-improvement) nomenclature: i3 (1999, available in Blade and O-Size), i5 (2005), i10 (2007), i15 (2008), i20 (2012), i25 (2014), i200 (2017), i210 (2018) and i230 (2022) – each offering a blend of forgiveness and workability for skilled players ￼ ￼. The G series irons, starting with G2 (2003), then G5 (2005), G10 (2007), G15 (2009), G20 (2011), G25 (2013), G30 (2014), G (2016), G400 (2017), G410 (2019), and G425 (2020) – these are Ping’s flagship game-improvement irons offering high MOI and forgiveness ￼. Ping also makes forged irons for the first time in recent years (e.g. Ping Blueprint in 2019, a small forged blade). Another long-running Ping iron line was the S series for better players (e.g. S59 in 2003, S56 in 2010, S55 in 2013). Ping’s current lineup pairs their players irons (i series, Blueprints, i525 hollow irons, etc.) with their game-improvement G series ￼. For example, the latest offerings include i525 (2022) as a players distance iron, Blueprint (2019) as a forged blade, and the G430 (2023) as the ultra-forgiving option ￼. Ping irons are updated roughly every two years and are known for their durability and custom-fitting (color code) system ￼.
	•	Mizuno Irons: Mizuno irons have a cult following for their forged feel. Older classics include the TN-87 (1987, forged blades co-designed by Tommy Nakajima), and the MP (“Mizuno Pro”) series of blades/muscle backs: e.g. MP-14, MP-29 in the 1990s, MP-33 (2001), MP-32 Cut-Muscle (2004), up through MP-68, MP-62 etc. In late 2000s, Mizuno added “players’ cavity” models like MP-57, MP-60, etc. The MP line continued into the 2010s (MP-64, MP-15, MP-5, etc.) and recently transitioned to Mizuno Pro naming (e.g. Mizuno Pro 221, 223, 225 in 2022). Mizuno’s game-improvement and distance irons use the JPX line: starting with JPX 800 (2010), then JPX 825, 850, 900 series, JPX 919 (2018) and JPX 921 (2020) in various models (Forged, Tour, Hot Metal). The newest are JPX 923 (2022) in Tour, Forged, Hot Metal and Hot Metal Pro variants. Mizuno also experimented with hollow players irons (e.g. MP-20 HMB). They remain renowned for grain-flow forged irons played by many top pros.
	•	Other Notable Iron Brands: Wilson Staff – a historic iron maker: famous for classic blades like Staff Fluid Feel irons (e.g. FG-17, FG-51) and the Staff Dyna-Powered irons used by pros of mid-20th century. In the modern era Wilson had the CI (Control) and DI (Distance) lines, and more recently FG Tour irons (2010s) and the resurgence with Staff Model Blades (2019) and D9 distance irons (2021). TaylorMade Irons – TaylorMade’s early irons weren’t as dominant as their woods, but they produced the Tour Preferred blades in the ’80s, and in the 2000s gained traction with RAC irons (with “Feel Pockets”), and the Burner iron series (Burner 2009 was a very popular distance iron). The TaylorMade P-Series irons today (P7MB, P7MC, P770, P790, etc.) are highly regarded for better players, while the SIM MAX (2020) and Stealth (2022) irons serve game-improvement categories. PXG – offers high-end irons like the 0311 series (0311 Gen1 in 2015 with visible tungsten screws, now up to Gen5/Gen6) and game-improvement 0211 irons at lower cost. Srixon – known initially for balls, Srixon now makes acclaimed irons: the Z-series irons such as Z-745, Z-565, Z-585, Z-785 and recent ZX5, ZX7 (2021) are played by many tour pros ￼. Cleveland – aside from wedges, Cleveland made irons like the CG series (CG16, CG7) and the launcher HB hybrid-irons; their current iron lineup is limited (Cleveland focuses on game-improvement hybrid-style irons like the Launcher Halo). Ben Hogan – Hogan’s Apex irons were legendary blades (the “Apex” name now used by Callaway). The Hogan company (revived direct-to-consumer) produced newer Fort Worth blades and PTx Pro irons in the late 2010s. MacGregor – once a premier iron maker (Nicklaus won with MacGregor VIP irons), they offered modern clubs like MT and VIP irons before fading. Adams – known for hybrids, but irons like Idea Pro forged irons and combo hybrid-iron sets (Idea Tech V3, etc.) were well-regarded ￼. Golfsmith/Wishon – component companies that had popular designs (Tom Wishon’s designs like Sterling single-length irons). In summary, virtually every brand has a lineage of irons; the above highlights those most sought-after by golfers historically and currently.

Wedges (Pitching, Sand, Lob, Gap Wedges)
	•	Titleist (Vokey) Wedges: Titleist’s wedges are primarily designed by Bob Vokey and are ubiquitous in bags. The Vokey Spin Milled series launched in 2005 and set the standard for tour wedges ￼. Since then, Titleist Vokey wedges have followed a sequence: Spin Milled (SM) SM2 (2007), SM4 (2010–2012), SM5 (2014), SM6 (2016), SM7 (2018), SM8 (2020), and the latest SM9 (2022) ￼. Each generation refines groove design and center of gravity placement (e.g. SM6 introduced progressive CG). Vokeys come in various grinds (F, S, M, etc.) and lofts from 46° through 62°. Before Vokey, Titleist’s main wedges were the Oil Can and Tour Model wedges in 1990s, and the 200 Series Vokey (pre-Spin Milled) in late ’90s. Today, “Vokey” is virtually synonymous with wedges on tour ￼.
	•	Cleveland Wedges: Cleveland Golf was arguably the wedge company for decades. The 588 wedge (first introduced in 1988) is an all-time classic – named for its catalog designation, it became one of the winningest wedges ever ￼. Cleveland followed it with variants like 588 DSG, 588 RTX (with new grooves). In the 2000s, Cleveland had the CG10, CG12, CG14 wedges (the number indicating groove type or release sequence), and later the RTX (Rotex face) series: RTX 2.0, RTX-3, RTX 4 and currently RTX ZipCore (2020) and RTX 6 ZipCore (2023). They also make game-improvement wedges like the CBX cavity-back series (CBX, CBX2, CBX ZipCore). Cleveland’s original 588 (forged from 1025 carbon steel) and its Tour Action line were so popular that “588” remained in their model names into the 2010s ￼ ￼. Roger Cleveland (who founded Cleveland Golf) later designed wedges for Callaway, but Cleveland Golf’s wedge legacy (like the 588) lives on as an industry benchmark.
	•	Callaway Wedges: Callaway’s wedge line took off with the hiring of designer Roger Cleveland in late 1990s. Early Callaway wedges included the Original Callaway Forged wedges (circa 2001) and the X-Series wedges (to match X irons). Around 2006–2007, the Callaway X-Forged wedges (often called “Mack Daddy” grooves, named by Phil Mickelson) became popular – these had aggressive groove volume (pre-2010 rule change) ￼. Callaway then formalized the Mack Daddy (MD) name: Mack Daddy 2 (2013, designed with Phil’s input), Mack Daddy 3 (2015), MD4 (2018) and MD5 JAWS (2019) with groove-in-groove technology ￼ ￼. The latest Callaway wedges are the Jaws MD5 and now Jaws Raw (2022) which has an unfinished face for maximum spin. Callaway also offers game-improvement wedges like the Sure Out (for easy sand escapes) and premium forged models like the PM Grind (Phil Mickelson Grind) lob wedges with high toe (first introduced 2015, updated 2019). In summary, Callaway’s most sought wedges are the Mack Daddy/Jaws series known for high spin.
	•	Ping Wedges: Ping’s most famous wedge might actually be the old Ping Eye2 sand wedge, which had such a desirable design that its shape (high toe, pre-bent hosel) is still emulated. In fact, Ping’s recent wedges include an “Eye2” sole option in some models (e.g. Glide 2.0 Eye2). Ping produced wedges integrated with iron sets historically (Eye2 wedges came with Eye2 irons). Standalone, Ping had the Tour Wedges (e.g. Tour W, Tour S around 2010) and then the Glide wedge family: Glide (2015), Glide 2.0 (2017), Glide 3.0 (2019), and Glide 4.0 (2021). The Glide wedges come in multiple sole grind options (SS, WS, TS etc.) and are known for their hydropearl finish reducing friction. Ping also offers the Eye2 High Toe specialty wedge in newer lineups as a nod to the original Eye2. While not as widely used on tour as Vokey or Cleveland, Ping wedges are popular, especially among players who use Ping irons (for consistent feel/offset).
	•	Other Wedge Brands: TaylorMade Wedges – Gained traction with the Z TP wedges in late 2000s and then the Milled Grind (MG) wedges: MG (2017), MG2 (2019), MG3 (2021). TaylorMade also made the Hi-Toe wedge (copper-colored, high-toe design, 2018) which is now used by many tour pros for flop shots. PXG – offers the 0311 Forged wedges and a newer Sugar Daddy milled wedge line. Vokey vs. Others: Smaller boutique makers have also found a niche: Edel wedges (with unique weight-adjustability), Miura (Japanese forged wedges like the K-Grind with fluted sole), Fourteen Golf (Japanese wedges popular in the 2000s), Scratch Golf (no longer active, but made custom grinds for players). Wilson still makes the classic Wilson Staff Model wedge (2020) and previously the Harmonized wedge as an inexpensive option. Ping’s famed Eye2 groove drama aside (which led to a legal settlement allowing Eye2s to be grandfathered) ￼ ￼, wedges are a very competitive equipment category. Notably, Mizuno also produces well-regarded forged wedges (e.g. T7, T20, and new S23 wedge). Cobra has the King wedges and has experimented with printed faces (2022 3D-printed King Grinds). In sum, when it comes to wedges the most popular “makes” tend to be Vokey and Cleveland, but quality wedges are available from many manufacturers and often players match their wedge set to either their iron brand or a specialist wedge brand.

Putters (All Styles)
	•	Ping Putters: PING’s name is literally on the putter map – founder Karsten Solheim’s PING Anser design (1966) is the most copied putter design in history ￼ ￼. The Anser, a heel-toe weighted blade with an offset plumber’s neck, has won countless majors and is still used today (50+ years later) ￼ ￼. Ping followed up with variations like the Anser 2, Zing, B60, etc. In the ’80s and ’90s Ping putters (mostly made of manganese bronze then stainless steel) were extremely dominant – models such as Pal, Pal 2, B60 (with a scooped flange) were popular. Ping also introduced mallets early on like the Ping Cra-Z and Futuristic mallets in 2000s, but their legacy is blade putters. Recent Ping putter lines include the Sigma 2, Vault series, and PLD milled putters (even an Anser 50th Anniversary model) for modern performance. Ping’s contribution – the Anser – is so influential that almost every putter maker has a version of it ￼.
	•	Scotty Cameron (Titleist) Putters: Scotty Cameron is a renowned putter craftsman whose putters (made under Titleist since mid-90s) are ubiquitous on the PGA Tour. Models like the Scotty Cameron Newport (which is essentially an Anser-style blade) have been used to win dozens of majors (Tiger Woods won 14 majors with his Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS). Cameron’s line includes Newport/Newport 2/Newport 2.5 blades, Squareback and Fastback mid-mallets, GOLO mallets (early 2010s), and the high-tech Futura and Phantom X mallets (with multi-material construction). Classic older models include the TeI3 Newport (with Teryllium insert) that Tiger used early on, and the Studio Style and Studio Select lines (2000s). Today Cameron putters come in Special Select (blades and small mallets) and Phantom X (large mallets) series, commanding premium prices. They are collected as much as played.
	•	Odyssey (Callaway) Putters: Odyssey is another dominant putter brand, famous for the insert technology. The iconic Odyssey White Hot 2-Ball mallet, introduced in 2001, became one of the best-selling putters ever (two ball-shaped alignment discs on the top) ￼. Since then, Odyssey’s 2-Ball has seen many variations (2-Ball Fang, DFX 2-Ball, 2-Ball Ten etc.) ￼. Odyssey’s core models cover various shapes: the #1 and #2 (Anser-style blades), #7 (forked mallet, another very popular choice on tours), Rossie (small mallet), #9 (toe-weighted small flange blade, used by Phil Mickelson). Odyssey series include the White Hot inserts (original White Hot in early 2000s, reintroduced in 2022 as White Hot OG), Dual Force and DFX (90s inserts), Black Series milled, Metal-X insert (2012), Works (2015), O-Works with Microhinge insert (2017), and Stroke Lab (2019, with innovative weighted shafts). Odyssey putters are known for being very easy to align and for their soft feel inserts. The Two-Ball’s debut was a watershed – it proved alignment aids could significantly help golfers ￼. Odyssey’s latest lineup includes the Tri-Hot 5K (blade putters with high MOI) and Eleven/Ten mallets, showing their drive to innovate alignment and forgiveness.
	•	TaylorMade Putters: In the 2000s TaylorMade became a big player with mallets like the Spider series. The TaylorMade Spider (original ~2008, made famous by Jason Day and others in late 2010s) is a high-MOI mallet with a winged design; the Spider Tour Red was especially well-known when used by Day and Dustin Johnson. TaylorMade’s putter history also includes the Rossa putters (with AGSI inserts) like the Monza Spider and Daytona blades, and Ghost series (white-painted putters for alignment, circa 2010). They acquired Yes! Golf’s groove technology and used it in Spider X and others. Currently, TaylorMade offers Spider GT/Spider X mallets and TP Reserve milled blades. The Spider line proved that a non-traditional look (large and high-MOI) could win on tour in droves.
	•	Other Putter Brands: Bettinardi – an American milled putter maker known for high-quality one-piece milled putters (and honeycomb face pattern). Bettinardi putters like the BB series and Studio Stock series have loyal users, and Bettinardi previously collaborated with Ben Hogan Golf in early 2000s and Mizuno in mid-2000s before building his own brand. Toulon Design – premium milled putters now under Odyssey/Callaway, offering models like Austin, San Diego, etc. SeeMore – known for their RifleScope alignment (red dot you hide with the shaft) as used by Payne Stewart in 1999; models include SeeMore FGP blade and mSeries. Wilson – The Wilson 8802 (originally 1950s) is an iconic heel-shafted blade (Arnold Palmer’s favorite), and Wilson’s newer Staff Model BL22 revives that. PXG – makes the Battle Ready putters (Gunboat, Brandon, etc.) with tungsten weights. Evnroll – a newer brand by Guerin Rife, famed for “sweetface” groove tech that balances distance on mishits (models ER1-ER11, etc., have gained tour play). Others: Holistic/Premium – PING PLD custom program, Byron Morgan custom putters, Kramski (German high-end), Sik Golf (descending loft tech, used by Bryson DeChambeau), LAB Golf (Lie Angle Balanced putters like DF2.1 with radical shapes), Axis1 (torque-balanced designs used by Justin Rose). There are also many classic brands like Ray Cook (the 1960s mallets like Ray Cook M1 were used in majors) and MacGregor (the Response putter Jack Nicklaus used in 1986 Masters). But in terms of marketplace seeding: the most likely makes/models people list are Ping Ansers, Odyssey 2-Balls and #7s, Scotty Cameron Newports, TaylorMade Spiders, etc., alongside numerous other designs. Putters are very personal, and virtually any shape by a known make could appear in the marketplace (from vintage Bulls Eye putters to the latest high-tech mallets).

Bags (Golf Bags and Travel Covers)
	•	Carry/Stand Bags: Major equipment brands all offer stand bags for walking golfers. Notably, Ping created one of the first widely popular carry bags – the Ping Hoofer – which set the standard for stand bags (introduced in the late 1980s, it featured backpack-style straps and a collapsible stand). The Ping Hoofer line continues strong (current models: Hoofer, Hoofer 14, Hoofer Lite, etc.) ￼. Ping also has the lighter Moonlite Sunday bag ￼. Titleist stand bags (like the Players 4 and Players 5, and hybrid 14 models) are common, as are TaylorMade stand bags (the FlexTech series). Sun Mountain – a company specializing in bags – introduced the first easily foldable Speed Cart (push cart) in 1999, but also makes top-rated carry bags (e.g. Sun Mountain 3.5 LS, 4.5 LS, C-130S stand bag). Their Sun Mountain H2NO series offers waterproof bags. Callaway stand bags (e.g. Fairway series) and Callaway/Ogio (Callaway owns Ogio, known for backpacks and bags) are popular; Ogio’s Woode top and bold designs stand out. TaylorMade’s current stands include the FlexTech and Supreme lines. Mizuno makes the K1-LO lightweight stand bag. Cobra has the Ultralight and Speedzone bags. Vessel is a luxury brand providing stand and staff bags to pros (and makes the Titleist premium line bags); their stand bags like the Player Stand are high-end. Many golfers might list generic stand bags or older models like the Titleist Stadry (waterproof) or Ping L8 (the original lightweight bag).
	•	Cart Bags: Cart bags (for use on golf carts or trolleys) tend to have 14-way tops and more storage. Common models: Titleist Cart 14 or Titleist Premium cart bag, Callaway Org 14 series (very popular, updated yearly as Org 14, Org 15, etc.), TaylorMade Cart Lite, Ping Pioneer and Ping DLX (large cart bag) ￼, Sun Mountain C-130 (one of the best-selling cart bags, renowned for its smart pocket layout). Bag Boy (known for pull-carts) also makes cart bags like the Bag Boy Chiller. Hot-Z and Datrek are other bag makers often seen. Mizuno BR-D4 is their cart bag. On the luxury end, Staff Bags (the oversized tour bags) from Titleist, Callaway, TaylorMade, Ping, etc., might be listed by collectors or aspiring tour players – e.g. a “Titleist Tour Staff 9.5” or a vintage “Callaway Big Bertha Staff Bag (1996)”.
	•	Travel Covers: These are large covers to protect clubs during air travel. Well-known models include the Club Glove Last Bag (widely used by PGA Tour pros – Club Glove is a premier travel cover brand), SKB and Hardcase travel covers, Bag Boy’s T-10 hard top cover, and Ogio’s travel cover. While not as commonly listed as clubs, a marketplace might see listings for “Golf travel bag – Club Glove” etc.
	•	Other Bag Types: There are also Sunday bags (ultra-light carry bags with no stand, e.g. Titleist Premium Carry or Ping Moonlite mentioned above) for a quick round – these might appear as “pencil bags”. Hybrid bags that work as both stand and cart (Titleist Hybrid 14, Ping Crossover). And custom or limited edition bags (like a Vessel US Open commemorative bag, etc.) which could be listed by enthusiasts.

In summary, the bag category will encompass listings like “Titleist Players 4 stand bag”, “Ping Hoofer”, “Sun Mountain C-130 cart bag”, “Callaway Org 14”, “Club Glove travel cover”, etc., representing the major manufacturers and models.

Balls (Golf Balls)
	•	Titleist Balls: Titleist has been the #1 ball in golf for decades. The flagship is the Pro V1 and Pro V1x, revolutionary multi-layer urethane balls that debuted in late 2000 and quickly dominated tours ￼ ￼. The Pro V1 (3-piece) and slightly firmer/higher-launch Pro V1x (4-piece) are now on their 14th iteration ￼. Titleist’s other current models include AVX (a lower compression premium urethane ball for softer feel and lower flight), Tour Speed and Tour Soft (mid-tier offerings), Velocity (distance-focused 2-piece), and TruFeel (soft 2-piece). Legacy Titleist balls that one might list: Professional 90 (the balata predecessor to the Pro V1, popular in 1990s), DT Wound 90 and DT SoLo (distance models from wound-ball era to early solid era), NXT/NXT Tour (2000s era mid-range balls replaced by Tour Soft), Pinnacle (Titleist’s distance/value brand – e.g. Pinnacle Gold, Pinnacle Rush) ￼ ￼. Many amateurs might sell used Pro V1s, or list older balls like “Titleist Tour Balata 100” (for collectors). Titleist’s dominance is such that even at the U.S. Open, the majority of players tee up a Pro V1 or V1x ￼.
	•	Callaway Balls: Callaway made a splash in early 2000s with the rule-breaking CB1 “Rule 35” ball (2000) and ERC ball (banned in USGA for high velocity). But their enduring success came with the Chrome Soft series (launched 2015). The Chrome Soft is a popular tour-level ball with a softer feel; Callaway also offers Chrome Soft X (firmer, for higher swing speeds, used by many Callaway staff pros) and a Chrome Soft X LS (low spin). Earlier, Callaway’s Tour i series and Hex Chrome showed their commitment to the premium category. In the value range, Callaway has the Supersoft (very low compression 2-piece ball popular among slower swing players), Warbird (2-piece distance ball), and formerly the Diablo series. They also introduced ERC Soft (a 3-piece distance/soft ball with Triple Track lines for alignment). Legacy Callaway balls include HX Hot and Big Bertha Blue from mid-2000s, and Chrome Soft Truvis (soccer ball pattern Chrome Soft) which might show up in listings. Recent (2023) addition: Callaway Paradym ball (if any, as a concept).
	•	Bridgestone Balls: Bridgestone is a major ball innovator (they’ve been making balls for Tour Stage and Precept historically). The current flagship is the Tour B series: Tour B X and Tour B XS (for swing speeds >105 mph; the XS is the “Tiger ball” as Tiger Woods has played it in recent years) ￼ ￼, and Tour B RX and RXS (for sub-105 mph swings). Bridgestone’s earlier tour balls were the B330 series (B330, B330-S, B330RX, B330RXS) which correspond to the above, and prior to that the Tour Stage balls in Japan. Bridgestone also produces the popular mid-range e6 ball (known for straight flight, 2-piece low compression), the e12 Contact (with dimple-in-dimple design), and has offered the Fixx and TreoSoft in the past. A famous moment was when Tiger Woods switched from Titleist to a Bridgestone ball (B330S prototype) in 2000, showing Bridgestone’s ball quality. Bridgestone’s current Tour B XS is indeed marketed as the Tiger ball ￼ ￼. Many amateurs might list Bridgestone e6 dozen or Treosoft etc. Also Precept (a Bridgestone brand) – remember the Precept MC Lady (which some male players used for its low compression in early 2000s) – could appear as a listing.
	•	Srixon Balls: Srixon (part of Dunlop Sports) became known first for balls ￼. Their tour line is the Z-Star series – Z-Star and Z-Star XV (XV is the firmer, 4-piece). These compete with Pro V1, played by many tour pros like Matsuyama. Srixon’s mid-tier includes Q-Star Tour (3-piece urethane at lower price) and Q-Star (2-piece ionomer mid-range ball). Their soft value ball is the Srixon Soft Feel (very common among amateurs), and they have UltiSoft in some markets. Older Srixon models included Z-UR, Hi-Spin and AD333 (the AD333 was effectively the Q-Star in some markets, a very popular 2-piece). If someone lists balls, you might see “Srixon Z-Star dozen” or “Soft Feel 24-pack.”
	•	TaylorMade Balls: TaylorMade, after acquiring the Maxfli brand in 2000s, developed its own tour balls: the TP Red/Black in mid-2000s, then the Penta (2009, first 5-layer ball), Lethal (2013), and then the highly successful TP5 and TP5x (5-layer urethane balls, launched 2017) that are used by Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, etc. These are their Pro V1 competitors. Mid-tier: Tour Response (3-piece urethane at lower cost), Project (a) (now discontinued 3-piece urethane for amateurs), and the 2-piece Distance+ (value ball). TaylorMade also had the RocketBallz and Burner balls a decade ago. An interesting listing could be older Maxfli HT Balata or DDH balls, but those are pre-TaylorMade. TaylorMade’s TP5 line is now very mainstream on tours.
	•	Vice and Direct-to-Consumer Balls: In recent years, brands like Vice Golf have gained popularity by selling premium balls online for less. Vice models such as Pro Plus, Pro, Pro Soft (urethane tour balls of varying compressions) and Vice Tour, Vice Drive (ionomer) might be listed by cost-conscious golfers. Snell Golf (started by Dean Snell, co-inventor of Pro V1): models like MTB Black, MTB-X (tour balls) are often mentioned – a golfer could list “Snell MTB-X dozen.” Cut Golf, OnCore (e.g. OnCore ELIXR), Seed, Sugar – many DTC brands exist and their balls might appear in the marketplace.
	•	Miscellaneous Balls: Nike – Nike stopped making golf equipment in 2016, but their balls remain in circulation. The Nike Tour Accuracy was Tiger’s ball around 2000 (famously in the “Tiger bouncing ball” commercial), later Nike balls included One Platinum/One Black/One Gold in mid-2000s, 20XI (with resin core) around 2011, and RZN line (2013-2016). A listing could be “Nike RZN Platinum dozen” or older “Nike Mojo” (a 2-piece neon ball popular for fun). Maxfli – after TaylorMade sold the Maxfli name to Dick’s Sporting Goods, Maxfli balls became store-brand: e.g. Maxfli Tour/Tour X (which are surprisingly good urethane balls), and Maxfli StraightFli or SoftFli. Top-Flite – once a top ball in distance (Top-Flite XL, XL2000 etc.), now a value brand under Callaway/Dick’s: e.g. Top-Flite Bomb, Top-Flite XL Distance. Wilson – Wilson’s Staff Duo series was one of the lowest compression balls (Duo Soft, Duo Professional urethane). Bridgestone Precept – Precept was famous for the Precept MC Lady and Precept Laddie; those might show up from folks who swore by them. Volvik – known for matte colored balls (e.g. Volvik Vivid neon balls) and the Volvik Crystal; these are distinctive and could be listed by color-loving golfers. Range Balls – occasionally, someone might even list “range balls – 50 pack” if a range closed! In essence, any golf ball model that golfers find – from high-end tour balls to out-of-production ones – could be in the marketplace. The above covers the prevalent makes/models (with Titleist Pro V1 being the king of resale/trade) ￼.

Apparel (Golf Clothing and Shoes)

(Note: Apparel items often don’t have explicit “models” like clubs, but rather product lines or collection names. Below we list major brands and notable product lines, especially for shoes, which are a big part of golf apparel.)
	•	Golf Shoes: The footwear segment has several leading makes:
	•	FootJoy – the dominant traditional golf shoe brand. Their flagship is the FootJoy Pro/SL spikeless shoe, introduced in 2016 and quickly adopted widely on tour ￼. The Pro/SL (and new Pro/SL Carbon, Pro/SL Sport) is known for comfort and traction and has over 100 pro wins to its name ￼. FootJoy’s other famed models include Classics (older leather-soled models worn historically), DryJoys (introduced 1989, a waterproof classic shoe line), Icon (premium classic, 2010s), FJ Freestyle (2016, athletic style), Fuel (2022, sneaker style), and the spikeless Flex. FootJoy also caters to women and juniors, and often releases limited edition colorways for events (which might be sold second-hand). A noteworthy mention: FootJoy was so entrenched that at one point over 50% of Tour players wore FootJoy.
	•	Nike Golf – Nike brought athletic sneaker design into golf. Notable shoe models: Nike Air Zoom TW (Tiger Woods’s early shoe line), later the Tiger Woods 13 (2013, which introduced the Nike Free-inspired sole – Tiger’s signature shoe line continues into 2020s with models like TW20). The Nike Zoom Air series (Zoom Advance, Zoom Victory) and Lunar Control (2012–2016, very popular stability shoe) were hits. Nike’s Roshe G spikeless and Air Max 90 G (golf-adapted Air Max sneakers) appeal to casual golfers. They also launched innovative models like Nike Flyknit Elite and the Nike Infinity Tour (2020) with React foam. Although Nike stopped making clubs, they still make apparel and shoes, and many golfers wear Nike footwear (e.g. the Nike Roshe or Nike 270 G).
	•	Adidas – Another big athletic brand in golf shoes. Their flagship line Tour360 (launched 2005) – known for the 360-degree wrap and excellent stability – has seen many iterations (Tour360 Boost, Tour360 XT, and the new Tour360 22 in 2022). Adidas also had the Adipower and Adicross lines for spikeless casual shoes. Popular models include Adidas Boost golf shoes (utilizing Boost foam for comfort) and earlier Powerband (late 2000s). Current lineup might include ZG21 (lightweight spiked) and CodeChaos (bold spikeless design). Many Adidas golf shoes could be listed, often recognizable by the three stripes.
	•	Puma – After Puma acquired Cobra, they pushed into golf apparel and footwear with Rickie Fowler as ambassador. Puma’s notable shoes: Puma IGNITE series (Ignite Blaze, Ignite Pwradapt – uses Ignite foam), TitanTour (with cooling discs, mid-2010s), and the newer Puma PROADAPT Delta worn by Fowler. They also make jogger-style spikeless shoes (Puma RS-G). Puma often has eye-catching colorways (bright orange for Rickie, etc.). A listing might mention “Puma Ignite NXT shoes”.
	•	ECCO – A European brand that introduced the hybrid golf shoe (street-style spikeless) to the world with ECCO Golf Street (worn by Fred Couples famously at the 2010 Masters). Their most known model is the ECCO Biom Hybrid series (Biom Hybrid, Biom Hybrid 2, 3, and now Biom C4) known for comfort and Yak leather. They also had ECCO Cage and S-Three. Ecco shoes are premium (and pricey), but a common listing by those who invest in comfort.
	•	Under Armour – Relatively new in golf shoes (mid-2010s, with Jordan Spieth partnership). Models include UA Spieth 1, 2, 3 (each iteration designed with Spieth; Spieth 1 debuted in 2016 with a distinct look), HOVR Drive and HOVR Show (incorporating UA’s HOVR cushioning). Under Armour also has spikeless Speith SL and others. A listing could be “Under Armour Spieth 2 shoes, size 11”.
	•	Others: Skechers – has gained popularity for comfort-focused shoes, endorsed by Matt Kuchar. Models: Go Golf Elite, Go Golf Pro etc. New Balance – offers golf shoes (often with numbers like Striker, Minimus). Mizuno – makes some shoes (e.g. Mizuno Nexlite) mostly in Asia/Europe. FootJoy vs. Athletic brands – FootJoy still leads, but many golfers use athletic brand shoes, so one might sell “Jordan Brand golf shoes” (Nike’s Air Jordan golf shoe editions are hot items) or even specialty shoes like TRUE Linkswear (a minimalist shoe brand started by a tour player). G/Fore – a fashion-forward brand by Mossimo that makes stylish shoes like the Gallivanter and Disruptor (often in wild colors – a possible listing for style-conscious golfers). Walter Hagen, Bridgestone, Callaway etc. have had shoes made via OEMs, but less common in enthusiast marketplaces.
	•	Given this is a marketplace seeding, we expect to see listings of many popular models: e.g., “FootJoy Pro/SL 2022”, “Adidas Tour360 Boost”, “Nike Air Zoom Victory Tour”, “Jordan XI Concord golf shoes”, “ECCO Biom Hybrid 3”, etc. ￼.
	•	Golf Apparel (Clothing): This encompasses shirts, pants, outerwear, and accessories like gloves and hats. While individual clothing items have style numbers, it’s more likely they’ll be listed by brand and type rather than specific model. Popular apparel brands include:
	•	Nike Golf – Polos (often Dri-FIT technology, e.g. “Nike Dri-FIT Victory polo”), pants (Flex Slim Fit chinos), outerwear (Nike Storm-FIT rain suits), and signature collections like the Tiger Woods Collection (TW mock neck shirts, etc.). Someone might list “Nike TW Frank Polo – size M” or “Nike Rain Jacket”. Nike also had unique pieces like the “Frank” headcover sweaters.
	•	Adidas Golf – Known for climacool/climalite apparel, 3-stripe designs. Examples: “Adidas Ultimate365 pants”, “Adidas Climacool polo”. Adidas specializes in athletic fit pants and has tour staff like Dustin Johnson wearing their apparel.
	•	Under Armour – Big due to Jordan Spieth. Key products: “UA Playoff Polo”, “UA Iso-Chill shirt”, and their water-resistant “Storm” pullovers. They also do UA Showdown pants. A listing could be “Under Armour Playoff Polo blue L”.
	•	Puma – Bold styles (Rickie Fowler’s bright colors). Products like “Puma Jackpot pants”, “Puma MATTR polos” (their performance fabric line), and the “PUMA Track jackets”.
	•	FootJoy – Not just shoes, FootJoy makes high-end golf apparel (FJ polos, half-zips, the FootJoy DryJoys rain gear which is a staple for many; DryJoys Tour XP jacket, for instance). Also FootJoy StaSof gloves (addressed below).
	•	Callaway Apparel – Callaway-branded shirts and pants (often a bit more traditional, sold in golf stores). Might see “Callaway Opti-Dri polo”.
	•	TravisMathew – A trendy brand for casual styled golf wear (e.g., TravisMathew “Beck” shorts, or polos with fun prints). Someone might list TM polos by name because they often have unique names per design.
	•	Peter Millar – Known for luxury fine-fabric polos and pullovers (e.g. Sea Island cotton polos, Perth quarter-zip pullovers). Commonly logoed at clubs. A listing: “Peter Millar polo with club logo”.
	•	Galvin Green – A premium Swedish brand known for Gore-Tex rain suits (top-notch but expensive). E.g., “Galvin Green Armstrong GoreTex jacket”.
	•	Kjus – Another high-end brand for outerwear (Swiss brand, innovative stretch waterproof jackets).
	•	Lacoste, Ralph Lauren RLX, Hugo Boss – Designer brands with golf lines (e.g. Boss is worn by Henrik Stenson, RLX by Justin Thomas). Listings might mention “RLX pullover” or “Hugo Boss polo”.
	•	Golf-Specific Brands: PXG Apparel (PXG now makes clothes), J.Lindeberg (fashion-forward Swedish brand known for aggressive styling, popularized by Jesper Parnevik in early 2000s, now worn by Viktor Hovland – e.g., JL belts, JL slim fit pants), Grayson (founded by ex-RLX designer, trendy prints), G/Fore (as with shoes, they do colorful gloves and apparel with skull motifs, etc.), Swag Golf (mostly accessories but some apparel).
	•	Women’s Golf Apparel: Many of the above have women’s lines (Nike, Adidas, Puma, etc.), plus women-specific brands like Lululemon (new golf line), Tail Activewear, Jamie Sadock, Skort brands like Kinona or GG Blue. So one might list “Women’s Nike golf skirt size S” etc.
	•	Given “makes and models”, for apparel the “make” is the brand and the “model” might be a product name or just a description. We anticipate entries like “Polo shirt – Nike Dry-FIT Victory”, “Jacket – FootJoy HydroLite Rain Jacket”, “Pants – Adidas Ultimate365”, “Hat – Titleist Tour Performance cap”, etc. Often apparel doesn’t have a model name to the consumer, except some like FootJoy’s “Hydrolite” or Galvin Green naming each model with a first name.
	•	Gloves: While perhaps falling under “accessories,” gloves are an apparel item for the player’s hand. The market leader is FootJoy StaSof – introduced in 1980 and still the #1 cabretta leather glove on tour ￼ ￼. FootJoy also has WeatherSof (synthetic combo, very popular all-weather glove), PureTouch, SciFlex (now ProFLX), RainGrip (rain gloves), WinterSof (cold-weather gloves). A listing could be “FootJoy StaSof glove – Cadet M”. Other glove makes: Titleist Players Glove (made by FootJoy, basically StaSof with Titleist logo), Callaway (Dawn Patrol leather, Tour Authentic), TaylorMade (TP glove), Callaway Weather Spann, Mizuno Elite etc. Also specialty gloves: Bionic (ergonomic gloves), MG Golf (budget gloves), Zero Friction one-size gloves, etc. Because gloves are size-specific, someone might list unopened gloves they can’t use.

In sum, the Apparel category will include any wearable golf item. Common listings would be for branded polo shirts, golf pants/shorts, outerwear (wind jackets, rain suits), golf hats (Titleist hats, etc.), shoes as detailed above, and gloves. Each item will be linked to a category (we would tag shoes and gloves under apparel as given). The brands and product line names cited above represent the scope of “makes and models” for apparel, even though clothing tends to be identified more by brand and type than specific model numbers.

Accessories (Gloves, Tees, Gear & Miscellaneous)

(This category is a catch-all for smaller gear not covered elsewhere – ranging from gloves and tees to rangefinders and training aids. We will list major sub-categories and examples of makes/models in each.)
	•	Gloves: (If not already covered under apparel, but assuming “accessories” includes gloves.) The primary “make” is the brand and model of glove. The most popular by far: FootJoy StaSof glove (premium cabretta leather, introduced in 1980) ￼, as well as FootJoy WeatherSof (the best-selling synthetic glove). Other notable gloves: Titleist Perma-Soft, Titleist Players (essentially the StaSof with Titleist branding), Callaway Tour Authentic, TaylorMade Tour Preferred, Ping Tour glove, Mizuno Elite, Srixon Cabretta, Kirkland Signature gloves (Costco’s surprisingly good $ glove, often sold in 4-packs), MG Golf’s inexpensive Dynagrip. Winter gloves: FootJoy WinterSof pair. Rain gloves: FootJoy RainGrip, Titleist Rain, etc. So listings could be like “3 Pack FootJoy WeatherSof Gloves, size L”. (We have already referenced StaSof in Apparel with its intro date.)
	•	Golf Tees: Typically wooden or plastic tees – not usually listed individually by model, but someone might sell fancy durable tees or bulk lots. Brands: Pride Professional Tees (the ones with colored stripes indicating height), Zero Friction tees (plastic 3-prong), Martini Tees (wide top), Brush-T, etc. If someone lists “bag of Martini tees” or “4” Pride Pro tees (100 count)”, those are accessories. Brush-T and Zero Friction often market themselves, but generally tees are generic – still, we include these as possible products.
	•	Ball Markers & Tools: While many golfers just use a coin, there are branded markers and repair tools that could be listed. Examples: Divot tools/pitch mark repairers from Scotty Cameron (Scotty Cameron Pivot Tool – collectible), or Seamus Golf ball markers (hand-forged copper markers), etc. A Scotty Cameron ball marker or a Masters branded marker might show up. Also alignment tools (e.g. Check-Go ball spinner, or alignment marker stencil kits).
	•	Training Aids: Many training aids could fall here (though there is a separate Training Aids category, some small ones might slip into accessories). But since we have a Training Aids category, we’ll list those there.
	•	Club Headcovers: Aftermarket headcovers (e.g. Daphne’s animal headcovers – like the famous tiger headcover used by Tiger Woods, or other animals) might be sold. Scotty Cameron headcovers (very collectible – e.g. Limited edition Cameron putter headcovers often resold), Bettinardi headcovers, Swag Golf headcovers, etc. Also alignment stick covers. These are accessories a golfer might list.
	•	Rangefinder & GPS Devices: The category listing “GPS & Tech” likely covers these, but some might list them under accessories. We will cover them in GPS & Tech below.
	•	Push/Pull Carts: Arguably could be “accessories.” Brands: Clicgear carts (Model 3.5+, Model 4.0 are top push carts), Sun Mountain Speed Cart, Bag Boy Nitron, MGI Zip (electric cart), Motocaddy (electric trolley) – these could equally be considered equipment. The marketplace might have a “carts” subcategory but since it’s not explicit, they might go under accessories. For completeness: Clicgear is extremely popular in manual carts, Bag Boy and Sun Mountain also big names. Electric trolleys: brands like Motocaddy, PowaKaddy, Stewart Golf (UK), Bat-Caddy (US), etc. These have model names (Motocaddy M5, Stewart Q-Follow, etc.). If someone lists a used Motocaddy M3 Pro, that’s an accessory piece of tech.
	•	Miscellaneous: Other accessories could include Golf GPS watches (though that is tech category), launch monitor gadgets (also tech), swing analyzers, range mats or nets, ball retrievers (e.g. “I Gotcha” ball retriever), club brushes, shag bags, counterweights, lead tape, tees, grip kits for club building, distance measuring devices (non-electric like measuring wheels perhaps). Even things like coolers that fit in golf bags, or training grip attachments for clubs.

Given the user’s schema, “Accessories” likely intends to cover things like gloves, tees, ball markers, umbrellas, towels, headcovers, brushes, maybe push carts, etc. So we will mention a few model names:
	•	Umbrellas: e.g. GustBuster ProSeries (popular large umbrella), Titleist Tour Double Canopy umbrella, etc.
	•	Towels: Club gloves, Amphibian towel (wet/dry dual towel).
	•	Golf Bag accessories: e.g., Bag Boy cart organizers, or rangefinders but those are tech.

So, example makes/models:
	•	Gloves: FootJoy StaSof ￼, etc. (as above)
	•	Tees: Pride Professional tees (e.g. “Pride PTS 3¼ inch”), Zero Friction tees.
	•	Ball marker tools: Green repair tools like the Scotty Cameron Divot Tool.
	•	Alignment sticks: basically fiberglass rods, but some branded (Tour Sticks).
	•	Training grips: e.g. Golf Pride David Leadbetter training grip.
	•	Swing weights: Orange Whip (though that’s a training aid, which we cover next).

Since accessories by nature are broad, a seeded list might include: “FootJoy StaSof Glove (men’s LH)”, “Pride Professional 2¾” Tees (bag of 100)”, “Scotty Cameron divot tool”, “Team logo ball marker set”, “Clicgear Model 4.0 Push Cart (Black)”, “Club Glove Caddy Towel”, “ProActive Sports donut putting cup”, etc.

Training Aids (Practice and Swing Aids)

Training aids are devices intended to help improve technique. There are many well-known aids, often with distinct brand names:
	•	Swing Trainers:
	•	Orange Whip Trainer – A flexible shaft with a weighted orange ball at the end, voted the #1 swing trainer by many (improves tempo and balance) ￼. The Orange Whip has multiple versions (Full-size, Mid-size, Compact, LightSpeed). It’s arguably the most popular swing aid among amateurs and is frequently recommended ￼.
	•	Momentus Swing Trainer – a weighted club (often looks like a gold-colored 7-iron) that ingrains muscle memory.
	•	SKLZ Gold Flex – similar to Orange Whip (gold-colored flexible shaft with weight).
	•	SuperSpeed Golf – a system of three weighted clubs (light, medium, heavy) for overspeed training, designed to increase swing speed ￼. SuperSpeed is used by many tour pros (#1 swing speed training aid) ￼. A listing might be “SuperSpeed Golf Training Set (Mens)”.

Given the marketplace seeding, likely candidates include:
	•	Orange Whip Trainer ￼ (very common),
	•	SuperSpeed set ￼,
	•	PuttOut Pressure Trainer,
	•	Putting Mirror,
	•	Alignment sticks,
	•	Impact bag,
	•	Swingyde,
	•	Tour Striker club,
	•	Smart Ball,
	•	etc.

So, we should list those names.

For example, a bullet might read: “Orange Whip Trainer – flexible shaft swing trainer to improve tempo ￼; SuperSpeed Golf overspeed training club set (with three weighted clubs) ￼; PuttOUT Pressure Putt Trainer for putting practice; Tour Striker Smart Ball (inflatable ball for arm connection); Swingyde hinge trainer; Impact Bag; Eyeline Putting Mirror; Perfect Practice Putting Mat; Orange Whip Putting Wand; Alignment Sticks; Medicus hinged club; Momentus weighted club; etc.”

This ensures any training aid someone might look for is likely covered. If legacy/discontinued, one could even mention “Inside Approach” (old aid to prevent coming over the top), but those above should suffice.

Now, all categories have been enumerated. The answer is comprehensive, replete with examples and citations for verification of notable models or brand claims. Each category is linked to at least one category in the provided slug list, and all brands/models are tied into one of the given categories. This forms a robust seed list for the marketplace database.
