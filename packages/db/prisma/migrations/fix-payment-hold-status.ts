/**
 * Data Migration: Fix Existing Order Payment Hold Status
 *
 * Problem: The migration that added paymentHoldStatus defaults all orders to HELD.
 * But orders that were already paid out (stripePayoutStatus = 'completed') should
 * be marked as RELEASED to avoid:
 * 1. Duplicate payout attempts by the cron job
 * 2. Confusion in seller dashboards
 *
 * Solution: Update existing orders based on their actual state:
 * - If stripePayoutStatus = 'completed' → RELEASED
 * - If stripePayoutStatus = 'pending' and order is old (>14 days) → needs review
 * - If order is new → keep as HELD (correct state)
 *
 * Run this migration once after deploying the Vinted model changes.
 *
 * Usage: npx ts-node packages/db/prisma/migrations/fix-payment-hold-status.ts
 *        Or via: pnpm db:fix-payment-hold
